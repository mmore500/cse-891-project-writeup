\begin{abstract}
Online European retailer Cdiscount maintains an online catalog of 30 million products.
Cdiscount could achieve greater efficiency in managing its catalog of products by automating the product classificiation process. 
Cdiscount organizes its products into more than 5,000 categories, posing an extreme multi-category classification scheme problem.
We aim to develop an approach that leverages data made available by the retailer to allow for accurate, automated cataloging of products based on their images.
We use existing convolutional neural network techniques (CNN) to classify images and investigate how to best exploit the hierarchical nature of the Cdiscount categorization scheme to reduce the complexity of the problem.
Specifically, we use a subset of the cDiscount dataset to compare the performance of an approach employing a hierarchically nested set of models to the performance of an approach using a single model. 
We find that our method of exploiting the hierarchical nature of the data performs worse than the traditional single model approach on a smaller-scale multi-category product classification problem, most likely due to overfitting to training data.
